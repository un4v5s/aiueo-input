aiueo-input
====

This app was created to facilitate communication for Japanese speakers who have difficulty vocalizing due to problems with their vocal cords.

By identifying the vowels from the shape of the mouth obtained from the image of the in-camera of tablet terminal and inputting the consonants on the touch panel, you can make the Japanese syllabary speak on your behalf.
